Hi Olga,

I read your challenge and I notice that you want to make sure someone can write code and also build a
decent UI piece without wasting your time. Time Olga is precious I was about to start a project and build out this project but now I also know that if I spend so much time on this I may never get the chance to even speak to you in person if it is not to your liking wasting my time and yours. I can produce a demo that I can share with you in person something that I worked on personally and can easily replicate.

Also I worked on Angular 2  for the last 18months and before that I worked on a Dojo UI project I did not have a professional assignment with react-redux.
